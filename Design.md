## Memory Typing Game
In this game, the player will be shown a string of random words to remember.

After a few seconds, the words will disapear and the player will have to type the words out by memory with a timer. If the player correctly types all words before the timer runs out, a new round begins, otherwise, they lose and must start over. 

Each round gets progressively harder. The number of words to remember increases, and the time to complete each one decreases.
